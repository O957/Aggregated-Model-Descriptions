    "section": "",
    "text": "As with (likely) most of the other models in this repository, their raison d’être is to facilitate forecasting on Metaculus question 22307, which is part of the Bridgewater Forecasting Contest. The resolution criteria for question 22307 reads:\n\nThis question will resolve as the number of tornadoes in the United States in April of 2024, according to the Storm Prediction Center’s preliminary tornado summary.\nIf the resolution value is below the lower bound or above the upper bound, the question resolves outside the respective bound.\nThe question will resolve as the number of tornadoes shown for the month of April 2024 when accessed by Metaculus on May 3, 2024. If there is a discrepancy between the “Map” and “Tables” views, the question resolves to the figure displayed on the “Map” view.\n\nBy the time you are reading this, the question has very likely closed. Also, given that the open upper bound on the question begins at 300 and that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Storm Prediction Center reports 310 as the number of preliminary tornadoes across the USA in April 2024, you might be saying to yourself, how can this brief report help me? Well dear forecaster, should a similar question come up on Metaculus, even if it is not necessarily about tornadoes, then the following discussion—on multilevel modelling—might enable you to produce better, more statistically informed Metaculus forecasts. There is additionally an argument to be made that \\[P(\\text{Finds The Below Interesting } | \\text{ Participates On Metaculus})\\] is high…but you can always stop reading at any time.\nBefore we begin, though, the author wants to note that NOAA does indeed permit data downloading; however, this process is quite tedious and annoying! Please commend the author on their patience manually copying the data into text files. The data available for use in modelling includes tornado, wind, and hail counts for each state, by month and year (1950 to 2024). Find the data here. The author downloaded the preliminary report values (given that this is the forecasting target for question 22307) for January 2019 to March 2024. Final reports were not downloaded since for many months across many states in the distant past, these report values are still not available.\nThe author is still maturing mathematically, so (please!) gaze upon the statistical sections with skeptical eyes. Note as well that the author operates by Crocker’s Rules, so criticism is welcome. To critique, please make a new issue here. The following was informed in part from Richard McElreath’s 13th chapter of Statistical Rethinking [1]"

    "text": "3.1 Random Intercepts And Slopes\nFrom the Wikipedia page on multilevel models (linked earlier), accessed 2024-04-20.\n\nBefore conducting a multilevel model analysis, a researcher must decide on several aspects, including which predictors are to be included in the analysis, if any. Second, the researcher must decide whether parameter values (i.e., the elements that will be estimated) will be fixed or random.[2][5][4] Fixed parameters are composed of a constant over all the groups, whereas a random parameter has a different value for each of the groups.[4] Additionally, the researcher must decide whether to employ a maximum likelihood estimation or a restricted maximum likelihood estimation type.[2]\nRandom intercepts model\nA random intercepts model is a model in which intercepts are allowed to vary, and therefore, the scores on the dependent variable for each individual observation are predicted by the intercept that varies across groups.[5][8][4] This model assumes that slopes are fixed (the same across different contexts). In addition, this model provides information about intraclass correlations, which are helpful in determining whether multilevel models are required in the first place.[2]\nRandom slopes model\nA random slopes model is a model in which slopes are allowed to vary according to a correlation matrix, and therefore, the slopes are different across grouping variable such as time or individuals. This model assumes that intercepts are fixed (the same across different contexts).5\nRandom intercepts and slopes model\nA model that includes both random intercepts and random slopes is likely the most realistic type of model, although it is also the most complex. In this model, both intercepts and slopes are allowed to vary across groups, meaning that they are different in different contexts.5"

    "text": "3.2 McElreath Multilevel Modelling\nDescription from pp. 400 of the 2nd edition of Statistical Rethinking:\n\nThese models remember features of each cluster in the data as they learn about all of the clusters. Depending upon the variation among clusters, which is learned from the data as well, the model pools information across clusters. This pooling tends to improve estimates about each cluster. This improved estimation leads to several, more prag- matic sounding, benefits of the multilevel approach. I mentioned them in Chapter 1. They are worth repeating.\n\nImproved estimates for repeat sampling. When more than one observation arises from the same individual, location, or time, then traditional, single-level models either maximally underfit or overfit the data.\nImproved estimates for imbalance in sampling. When some individuals, locations, or times are sampled more than others, multilevel models automatically cope with differing uncertainty across these clusters. This prevents over-sampled clusters from unfairly dominating inference.\nEstimates of variation. If our research questions include variation among individu- also or other groups within the data, then multilevel models are a big help, because they model variation explicitly.\nAvoid averaging, retain variation. Frequently, scholars pre-average some data to construct variables. This can be dangerous, because averaging removes variation, and there are also typically several different ways to perform the averaging. Aver- aging therefore both manufactures false confidence and introduces arbitrary datatransformations. Multilevel models allow us to preserve the uncertainty and avoid data transformations\n\n\nDescription from pp. 401 of the 2nd edition of Statistical Rethinking:\n\nRethinking: A model by any other name. Multilevel models go by many different names, and some statisticians use the same names for different specialized variants, while others use them all inter- changeably. The most common synonyms for “multilevel” are hierarchical and mixed effects. The type of parameters that appear in multilevel models are most commonly known as random ef- fects, which itself can mean very different things to different analysts and in different contexts.193 And even the innocent term “level” can mean different things to different people. There’s really no cure for this swamp of vocabulary aside from demanding a mathematical or algorithmic definition of the model. Otherwise, there will always be ambiguity"
