## Configuration Specification Language (CSL) Files

The `csl` style comes from a slightly modified version of Vodohospodářské technicko-ekonomické informace (English) (2016-03-10 11:08:39); the original version can be downloaded from [Zotero's style repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles/vodohospodarske-technicko-ekonomicke-informace-en).

## Fonts

The font for code blocks is [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka), specifically [this version](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/releases/download/v30.3.2/PkgTTF-Iosevka-30.3.2.zip). The body font the Schola theme of the [TeX Gyre](https://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre) collection, which can be found [here](https://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/schola/index_html).
