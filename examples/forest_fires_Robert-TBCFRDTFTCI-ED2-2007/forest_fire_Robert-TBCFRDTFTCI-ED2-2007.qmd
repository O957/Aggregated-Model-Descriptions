# Example 1.1.1 From Robert-TBCFRDTFTCI-ED2-2007

On page 2, a model for forest fires is given:

$$p = \frac{\mathtt{exp}(\alpha_1 h + \alpha_2 t + \alpha_3 x)}{1 + \mathtt{exp}(\alpha_1 h + \alpha_2 t + \alpha_3 x)}}$$

where:

* $p$ is the probability of a fire
* $h$ is the humidity rate
* $t$ is the average temperature
* $x$ is the degree of management of the forecast
